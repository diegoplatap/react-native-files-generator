# Screen and View Generator for React Native

This Visual Studio Code extension simplifies the process of creating new screens and views for React Native applications. It allows you to quickly generate boilerplate code for a screen and its corresponding view, including the necessary imports and basic structure.

## Features

- Generate new screens and views with a single command.
- Automatically create `Screen.tsx` and `View.tsx` files with predefined templates.
- Choose to create files in the root of the `screens` and `views` folders or within a specific subfolder.
- Option to create a new subfolder if it doesn't already exist.
- Check for existing files and prompt to overwrite if necessary.

## Usage

To use the extension, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type `Add Screen and View` and select the command.
3. Enter the name for the new screen and view when prompted.
4. Select a subfolder or choose to create a new one. You can also select the root option to create files directly in the root of the `screens` and `views` folders.
5. The extension will generate the files and open them in the editor.

## Requirements

This extension assumes that your project has a `src` folder with `screens` and `views` subfolders. If the `src` folder does not exist, the extension will show an error message.
